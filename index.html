            <h3>Junior Web Developer and undergraduate student</h3>
            <p>Studying the web development inspires me to excel in computer science 
                because nothing else like it exists. Throughout my years as 
                a computer science student, I've encountered a wide range of 
                course subjects and programming languages. However, as soon 
                as I was exposed to web programming, it piqued my curiosity. 
                I felt like I'd discovered my calling, and I was looking forward 
                to seeing where my work would lead me. My ambition is to become 
                a well-known senior web developer for various well-known companies 
                in multiple locations worldwide.</p>
